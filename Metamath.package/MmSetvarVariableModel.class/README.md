$( Introduce the class builder or class abstraction notation ("the class of
     sets ` x ` such that ` ph ` is true").  Our class variables ` A ` ,
     ` B ` , etc. range over class builders (implicitly in the case of defined
     class terms such as ~ df-nul ).  Note that a setvar variable can be
     expressed as a class builder per theorem ~ cvjust , justifying the
     assignment of setvar variables to class variables via the use of ~ cv . $)
